# Backend - API Implementation for Launch-Pizza
<br/>

To run
```bash
$ cd Launch_Pad_Practice
$ npm start
```

**Defination of the user entity**
```bash
firstName: "Nick",
lastName: "Don",
age: 21,
user_id: "123"
```
A user entity should contains the user's first name, last name, age, and an identical user_id generated by using the uuid library.

**Defination of the order entity**
```bash
pizza_name: "abc",
user_id: "123",
status: "processing"
```
A order entiry should contains the pizza_name, user_id, and order's status.

**APIs in the users.js file**

Used **users** and **menu** arrays to store all users' information and pizzas available in the menu respectively to act as the fake database. In reality, we should store and get the data from database. 

Furthermore, all APIs have been tested using Postman

|Operation      |Endpoint       |Description                                             |
|-------------  |-------------   |------------------------------------------------------ |
|GET  |http://localhost:5001/users/menu           |Find all pizzas in the menu           |
|GET  |http://localhost:5001/users                |Find all users' information           |
|POST |http://localhost:5001/users                |Add a new user into database          |
|GET  |http://localhost:5001/users/{user_id}      |Find a user's information via user_id |


**APIs in the order.js file**

Used **orders** and **menu** arrays to store all orders information and pizzas available in the menu respectively to act as the fake database. Also, here I assume that the both users.js and order.js files can access to the same database. 

|Operation      |Endpoint        |Description                                                                                                         |
|-------------  |-------------   |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|GET  |http://localhost:5001/orders                                       |Find all order history in the database                                     |
|POST |http://localhost:5001/orders/{user_id}/{pizza_name}                |Add a new order, contains user_id and pizza_name, to the database          |
|GET  |http://localhost:5001/orders/{user_id}/{pizza_name}                |Find the user's order status based on user_id and the name of the pizza    |
|GET  |http://localhost:5001/orders/{user_id}                             |Find the user's ordering history (all receipt) using user_id               |

**Potential Improvements**

1. We actually should also implement an API that allows the admin to update the order's status.

2. We should also implement an API that allows the admin to update the menu. 

3. We should also assign an identical order_id generated by uuid library for each order, like what I did for user_id, besides the pizza_name.

4. In order to allow user to see a receipt of their order for up to one year, we may need to add a time attribute to our database so that we can do the SQL query like the following:

```bash
SELECT order 
FROM orders, users
WHERE users.user_id = user_id AND orders.user_id = user_id AND curr_time - orders.order_time >= 1
```
